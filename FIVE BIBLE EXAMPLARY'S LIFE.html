    <li><b>THE THREE HEBREW CHILDREN</b> which were named Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego were children of God and followed the way of the Lord and did what was right in the side of the Lord. At that time King Nebuchadnezzar had captured their city and were working for him. At a particular time, King Nebuchadnezzar made a graven image and told everyone to bow down to the graven image but unfortunately the three hebrew children did not bow down to the image and this made King Nebuchadnezzar very angry and called them and theathened to throw them in a very hot fiery furnace but the three hebrew children did not still bow and King Nebuchadnezzar commanded that they should be thrown into the furnace. After some time King Nebuchadnezzar went to check the bodies whether they had been burnt but to King Nebuchadnezzar's suprise, he saw four men and asked his servants saying "Were it not three men I threw into the furnace, but I see four men and the last one looks like the <b>Son of God</b>" then King Nebuchadnezzar commanded that they should be brought out of the furnace and King Nebuchadnezzar commanded the whole city to worship and bow down for the God of the three hebrew children.

    <li><b>MARY(THE MOTHER OF JESUS)</b> was a virgin and never went near any man and she was respected by people for that. One day, she was in the garden, Angel Gabriel appeared unto Mary and said unto her "Be not afraid for thou has been favoured by God and thou shall conceive a child and thou shall name him <b>"JESUS"</b>  for he shall save his people from their sins. But be not afrid for Joseph shall take thee as a wife" But Mary asked "How will I conceive when I have not slept with any man before" And Angel Gabriel answered and said that the Holy Spirit will guide and conceive in her. Mary obeyed and God blessed her and baby <b>JESUS</b>was given birth to in a manger and the angels of the Lord filled the sky and were praising and appreciating <b>GOD</b> saying <b>"Hosanna in the highest for a King has been born in Bethlehem"</b> and they came down and worshipped <b>JESUS</b>. </li>

    <li><b>JOSEPH OF EGYPT</b> was the eleventh son of Jacob and first son of Rachael. Jacob loved him because of Rachael was his best wife among others. Jacob bought a coat of many colours for Joseph and this made his brothers to hate him and they did not have love for him as a brother. Joseph had a dream and in the dream all of his brother's lot bowed down to his own lot. This made his brothers more angry at him and because he normally brings evil report that his brothers did and because as usual, Joseph will always come to check on his brothers, they devised a plan that when Joseph comes to check on them again that day, they will throw him into a pit and lie to their father that a wild animal killed him. At a point, they saw some Ishmaelites traders passing by and they said to them selves saying that they should sell him to them and then tear his clothes and soak it in a bowl of blood and show it to their father. Meanwhile, Reuben came after a while and went to the pit to carry Joseph out of the pit but unfortunately, he was no longer there and Reuben was very angry with his brothers and rented his clothes.     While in EGYPT, Joseph was in Potiphar's houuse as a servant and Potiphar loved him more than any other servant and put him in charge of everything in his house. But, Potiphar's wife was looking for a way for both to sleep together but Joseph will not answer. Then a day came that she wanted him to sleep with her by all possible means and Joseph said that he can't sleep with her and sin against <b>GOD</b>. Then she forced him and dragged his clothes and so Joseph left his garment with her and ran away. Potiphar's wife was angry and so she tore her clothes to pretend to her husband that Joseph raped her and so that he will punish Joseph. Potiphar came back home only to see his wife crying with torn clothes and so he asked what happened and his wife lied against Joseph and this made Potiphar very angry and sent for Joseph and put him in prison. while in prison, he interpreted dreams and this made one of them to remember him when Pharoah wanted someone to be able to interprete his dream that he didn't understand. Pharoah made Joseph the peron in charge of food and the grains. Famine came as God had shown Pharoah, and this made Joseph's brothers to come to Egypt to buy food for their family to eat. When they got there, they saw the Prime Minister(not knowing that it was their brother that they were bowing doown to.) He later told them all that had happened to him and Joseph brought all his family to Egypt in Goshen with their father.</li>
